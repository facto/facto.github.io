title: "How I Estimate with Pivotal Tracker"

I've used Tracker for many years and find that it still provides tremendous value. There's an age-old debate: **which story point method should I use?** To me, the fibonacci sequence for story points is the most flexible and descriptive.

However, it seems that every developer has their own interpretation of what each point value actually means. I don't think this is bad so long as everyone on the project has the same understanding.

This is my preferred interpretation:

**0:** Trivial and directly affects and is noticeable by the user (e.g., fixing a typo, altering some copy).

**1:** Everything is known, and the feature is straightforward.

**2:** Everything is known, and the feature has some complexity.

**3:** There's a good idea of how to move forward, but there's an integration or some other aspect that may add unforeseen complexity.

**5:** Too high-level and/or involves a large amount of complexity. Needs to be planned and possibly spiked.

**8:** Pie-in-the-sky
