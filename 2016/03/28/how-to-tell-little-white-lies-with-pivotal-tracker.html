    <p><a href="http://softwareforgood.com/estimates-lies/">Estimates are always lies</a>. But let’s forget about that for a second.</p>

<p>I’ve used <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a> for many years and find that it still provides tremendous value. There’s an age-old debate: Which story point scale should I use when estimating? Is the default setting (Linear, or 0,1,2,3) sufficient?</p>

<p>I think there’s a more important question: <strong>What do story point values <em>mean?</em></strong></p>

<p>This turns out to be pretty tricky. A little googling will quickly reveal that almost every developer has their own interpretation.</p>

<p>The answer needs to provide conceptual tools to aid our estimation efforts, not hinder them, or worse, frustrate us to the point of abandoning them altogether.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that there’s no such thing as perfection in Estimation Land, consider the fibonacci sequence (0,1,2,3,5,8) interpreted as follows:</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>0:</strong> Something trivial which directly affects and is noticeable by the user (e.g., fixing a typo, altering some copy).</p>

<p><strong>1:</strong> A feature about which everything is known, and implementation is straightforward.</p>

<p><strong>2:</strong> A feature about which everything is known, and there’s some complexity involved.</p>

<p><strong>3:</strong> A somewhat fuzzy feature. There’s a good idea of how to move forward, but there’s an integration or some other aspect that may add unforeseen complexity.</p>

<p><strong>5:</strong> A feature that needs to be planned. It’s too high-level and/or involves a large amount of complexity. Some exploratory work may need to be done.</p>

<p><strong>8:</strong> A pie-in-the-sky feature. There’s lots of discussion, exploration and planning to be done.</p>

<hr />

<p>I find this fulfills my requirements for a useful estimation method.</p>

<p>Also, consider these meta rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Nothing above a 3 should ever be started.</strong> This means that 5s and 8s should always be broken down. The resulting stories will often add up to more than 5 or 8. That’s ok.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, <strong>try not to put 5s and 8s in the backlog</strong>. I find they skew the overall point count. They should really be 21s and 55s to better reflect what they often turn out to be in practice.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Remember: estimates are always lies. However, they can be <em>useful</em> little white lies that help us inch closer to the truth.</strong></p>
