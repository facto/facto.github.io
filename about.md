Hi! You can call me Josh or Joshua. I go by either. I don't really care. :)

## Pro

My passion is [micropreneurship](http://www.businessn2k.com/rise-of-the-micropreneur/).

I'm cofounder of [ExCasts](http://excasts.com), an Elixir-based screencasting service, which reminds me... Elixir is my favorite language, followed by Ruby and JavaScript.

I run a tiny web software consultancy called [Whole Bean Productions](http://wholebean.net). I say tiny because it's tiny (we're 2 people) and because that's exactly how I feel it should be.

Though I spend most of my time on the web, my professional interests are not limited to it. Unity and iOS development once held my interest. I enjoy revisiting those every now and then.

## Per

My wife and I live in a Class A RV and roam around the country as [digital nomads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad). We maintain a log of our travels at [Ardent Camper](http://ardentcamper.com).

I enjoy working on my RV (a 2002 Fleetwood Southwind), which I lovingly refer to as my robo-house.
